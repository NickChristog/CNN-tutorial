# CNN-tutorial
This is a simple NN. Its NOT a CNN, With only 1 Dense layer.

We train the model for 6 epochs.
We repeat this process for 5 different values of the Dense layers Neurons.
Through the Log files that are provided we can have and overview of what is more accurate.


I used Pycharm to run this...and the requirements for it are
  * Tensorflow GPU/CPU
  ~~ * Numpy ~~
  * Keras
  
  
  I installed them through the project settings inside of Pycharm as they need to be installed on every project separately.
